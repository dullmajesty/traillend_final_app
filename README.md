TrailLend Mobile App — How It Started

After completing the web-based administrative system, the team began developing the TrailLend Mobile App to make barangay lending more accessible and convenient for residents.
While the web version focuses on management and monitoring, the mobile app was designed primarily for borrowers — providing a smooth way to reserve, track, and return items anytime, anywhere.

The mobile application was built using React Native and Expo, allowing it to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
It connects directly to the Django REST API from the web system, ensuring real-time data synchronization for all modules.

Through the app, users can:

View the list of available barangay equipment such as tents, chairs, and sound systems.
Submit reservation requests by selecting an item, quantity, and desired borrowing date.
Receive instant notifications when their reservation is approved, declined, or due for return.
Scan or present their QR code for verification using the ESP32-CAM module at the barangay office.
Report damaged or missing items with attached images for faster action.
The app also features a responsive and user-friendly interface that matches the clean, professional style of the web dashboard — making it intuitive even for first-time users.
The TrailLend mobile app is a major step toward digitizing barangay services, ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency for both barangay officials and residents.
